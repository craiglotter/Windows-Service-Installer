Windows-Service-Installer
=========================

Windows Service Installer adds a graphical user interface to Microsoft's InstallUtil.exe application used to install Windows services. Windows Service Installer simply monitors its Install directory for service executables to install and invokes InstallUtil to do the actual installation. The installer also automatically starts the service. The text file inputs.txt contains the customised labels.  Created by Craig Lotter, January 2006
